                On a never ending fitness journey. Sometimes life gets in the way but sport and exercise will always be there

            <p class="before-gymnast">
              Perhaps my greatest character defining trait as a child was that I was a gymnast. I started training at a very
              young age and continued into high school. My dream had been to go to the olympics at the age of 22. Life of course
              had other plans and instead I left the sport at the age of 15. Even with over a decade between that era and now
              (2023 time of writing), I still thank my gymnastics training for shaping my life, and I truly love the sport even
              in spite of its negatives. I have gymnastics to thank for my ability to maintain a relatively high degree of
              fitness in adulthood without needing to put much effort into training for somewhat long periods of time. I believe
              the hard work I put into gymnastics as a child has set me up with many advantages in life, not just in sport.
            </p>
            <p class="before-wrestler">
              Right after leaving gymnastics, I took up free style wrestling. As you might imagine given my training, I had a
              big strength advantage over many wrestlers, but it would be wrong to say I joined the sport and dominated. My
              cardio needed a lot of work, and anybody who has trained in combat sports knows how important technique is.
              Wrestling became my high school life. It's taught me many lessons and granted me an incredible appreciation for
              the broader world of athletics, challenging and outright tearing down the elitist mindset of my younger gymnast
              self.
            </p>
            <p class="before-runner">
              In my university days I had very casually taken up long distance running. My enthusiasm about it waxed and waned
              over time. Eventually, in the year before
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">the pandemic</a>, I had challenged myself to run every
              day. For a good chunk of the year I stuck to it, and it certainly had a profound impact on me. Since then, while
              I'm not always consistently training, I can confidently and proudly say that I am a runner.
            </p>
            <p class="before-climber">
              I got into climbing on a whim and fell in love with it pretty quick. I like challenging my strength with it,
              landing a good dyno, and of course, I dread slabs!

            <p class="before-piano">
              From a young age I was trained in classical piano studies. While a lot of that skill has been lost to childhood
              now, I might still primarily call myself a pianist.
            </p>
            <p class="before-drums">
              In middle school I picked up percussion to be the drummer in a band that ultimately only played one show. While
              rhythm comes naturally to me and playing drums is incredibly fun, I would hardly consider myself a drummer
              anymore.
            </p>
            <p class="before-guitar">
              In high school I jumped on the guitar band wagon as well. I was quite serious for a time about developing my
              skill, however I'd never taken any lessons and slowly stopped caring about being one of the best. Nowadays the
              guitar is the easiest to reach for and it's a joy to sing along to a four chord song.
